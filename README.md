About Me

I'm a partially dedicated software developer, primarily focusing on Python and a rich array of technologies. 

I started my journey 5 years ago by learning the basics of Python and computers. The pandemic made me explore computers and grew my interest and passion for it. Today, im an experienced developer messing around with stuff to learn as much as possible. 
Im looking to expand and learn more languages to develop better solutions. I also love technology! I read and mess around with things. I love exploring new areas such as linux, learning the fundamentals of Windows. Any problem i encounter means i learn more by           finding solutions! Currently, my focus is to sharpen and improve my skills and learn about all the different things Python has to offer. Feel free to check out my projects so far!
